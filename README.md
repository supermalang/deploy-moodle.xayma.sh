Deploy Moodle
=========

This role is for deploying and managing Moodle instances with different versions.

It is intended to be used with the Ansible Tower and the Xayma.sh Platform already deployed (with all it's components).
However if you want to use command create and manage n8n instances from the command line, with the Xayma.sh Platform already deployed, you can use the following:

```bash
ansible-playbook site.yml -i production --tags "deploy" --extra-vars "organization=xaymasolutions instancename=automation domain=moodle.xaymasolutions.com" --vault-pass-file "vault_password" -K
```

Requirements
------------
- Deployment of the Xayma.sh Platform. Otherwise this is completely useless.
- Make sure to use the secret vault password ðŸ˜Ž. Can be a file (if you are using CLI) or a credential record in Ansible Tower.
